# Here is an example of a Python script that uses a trained natural
# language processing (NLP) model to generate a response to the input:


import pickle

# Load the trained NLP model
with open("nlp_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    nlp_model = pickle.load(f)

# Define a dictionary of possible responses
responses = {
    "greeting": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey!"],
    "goodbye": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Bye!"],
    "thanks": ["You're welcome!", "No problem!", "Anytime!"]
}

# Function to generate a response
def generate_response(text):
    # Predict the intent of the input
    intent = nlp_model.predict([text])[0]
    # Select a random response from the dictionary
    return np.random.choice(responses[intent])

# Get input from the user
input_text = input("What would you like to say? ")

# Generate a response
response = generate_response(input_text)
print("Response:", response)
# This script loads the trained NLP model using pickle, defines a
# dictionary of possible responses for different intents, and then defines a function
# "generate_response" that takes text as input and uses the NLP model to predict the intent
# of the input text, and then selects a random response from the dictionary of possible responses
# according to the predicted intent. Finally, it gets input from the user and generates a response using the
# function.
#
# It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, in real-world scenarios you may want to use more
# complex models and a more sophisticated way to generate responses, also you may want to use pre-trained
# models like GPT-3 or BERT for this task.
#


# Here is an example of a Python script that uses a text-to-speech model
# to convert the response text to speech, using the popular open-source library,
# gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):


from gtts import gTTS
import os

# Function to convert text to speech
def text_to_speech(text, filename):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(filename)
    os.system("mpg321 " + filename)

# Get the response text
response_text = "Hello!"

# Convert the response text to speech
# text_to_speech(response_text, "response.mp3")
# This script uses the gTTS library to convert the response
# text to speech, it takes the response text and the desired filename as
# input, creates a gTTS object, saves the speech to a file and plays the file
# using os.system("mpg321 " + filename) command.
#
# It's worth noting that gTTS uses Google's Text-to-Speech API and requires
# an internet connection to work, also you may want to use other libraries such
# as pyttsx3 or other cloud services like AWS Polly, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or
# Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech to convert text to speech.



# how can I use my microphone for this to work and convert that into an audio file
# You can use the pyaudio library in Python to record audio
# from a microphone and save it as a file. Here's an example of how you can
# use it to record audio from a microphone and save it as a WAV file:
#
#
# Yes, you can use the librosa library in Python to record audio from a
# microphone and save it as a file. Here's an example of how you can use it to
# record audio from a microphone and save it as a WAV file:


import librosa
import sounddevice as sd

fs = 44100  # Sample rate
seconds = 5  # Duration of recording

print("Recording...")
recording = sd.rec(int(fs * seconds), samplerate=fs, channels=2)
sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished

# Save the recording as a wav file
librosa.output.write_wav("recorded.wav", recording, sr=fs)
print("Recording saved as recorded.wav")

# This code will record audio from the microphone for 5 seconds and
# save it to a file named recorded.wav in the current working directory.
# You can adjust the value of seconds to change the length of the recording.
#
# Please note that you need to have librosa and sounddevice libraries installed
# on your machine to use this code, you can install them using pip by running pip install librosa sounddevice.
#
# Then you can use this audio file to preprocess it and use it in the training process
# of your speech-to-text model.
# Also, you can use other libraries like pyaudio or scipy to record audio if you want.
#

# To start the code, you can simply run the script from the
# command line or from your IDE, after that, the code will execute and
# wait for your command, it will start recording the audio from your microphone
# once you say something and it will stop recording after the specified duration.
#
# You can use the following code snippet to initiate the recording process
# only when it receives a specific keyword or phrase, this is commonly known as wake word:
#





# can you create a code using snowboy module for wake up voice recognition and save to a WAV file
# Sure, here is an example of how you can use the snowboy library
# to create a wake-up word detection and save the audio to a WAV file:


import librosa
import sounddevice as sd
from pvporcupine import Porcupine

# Define the callback function that will be triggered when the wake-up word is detected
def detected_callback():
    print("Recording...")
    recording = sd.rec(int(fs * seconds), samplerate=fs, channels=2)
    sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished
    librosa.output.write_wav("recorded.wav", recording, sr=fs)
    print("Recording saved as recorded.wav")

# Define the wake-up word
wake_word = "alexa"

# Define the sample rate and duration of the recording
fs = 44100  # Sample rate
seconds = 5  # Duration of recording

# Initialize the Porcupine detector
porcupine = Porcupine(
    library_path='libpv_porcupine.so',
    model_file_path='alexa.ppn',
    keyword_file_paths=[wake_word + '.ppn'],
    sensitivity=0.5,
    output_callback=detected_callback
)

# Start listening for the wake-up word
print("Listening for the wake-up word: " + wake_word)
porcupine.start()
# This code will listen to the microphone and continuously check for the
# wake-up word "alexa" using Porcupine, once the wake-up word is detected, the
# detected_callback function will be triggered, which will record audio from the
# microphone for 5 seconds and save it to a file named recorded.wav in the current working directory.
# You can adjust the value of seconds to change the length of the recording.
#
# It's worth noting that this code uses a pre-trained model of "alexa" keyword,
# you can download it from the Porcupine website. Also, you will need to provide
# the path to the Porcupine library, it should be the path to the folder where the library is
